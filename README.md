# demodb.org Scraper

Scrapes demo song MP3 files from demodb.org 😁 (sorry to demodb.org founders - if there's a way I could buy your recordings, I would do that instead!!)

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npx ts-node src/index.ts <page URL>
```

`page URL` is a keyboard page with songs on it - eg, "https://demodb.org/en/yamaha/psr/psr-340":

```bash
npx ts-node src/index.ts https://demodb.org/en/yamaha/psr/psr-340
```
